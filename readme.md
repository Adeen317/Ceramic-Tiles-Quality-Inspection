This repository contains the implementation for a defect detection system for ceramic tiles using OpenCV library in Python. The system employs the template matching algorithm and contours to identify and highlight defects in tile surfaces. It is also integrated into a conveyor belt system where our system automatically seperates the defected tiles. 

### Overview
The system utilizes OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library, to perform defect detection on tile images. The main components of the system include:

##### Template Matching Algorithm: Employed to find instances of a predefined defect template within tile images.
##### Contours: Used to outline and highlight detected defects, enabling easy visualization and analysis.
### Features
##### Contour Detection: Identifies and outlines areas of interest, making defects more visible.
##### Python Implementation: All code is written in Python, making it easy to understand and modify using computer vision techniques.
### Usage
To use this system:

##### Clone the Repository: git clone https://github.com/Adeen317/Ceramic_Quality_Inspection.git
##### Install Dependencies: Ensure you have OpenCV installed (pip install opencv-python)


This project is also implemented in pytorch-yolov5 you can access it from here [source](https://github.com/Adeen317/Ceramic-Tiles-Quality-Inspection-YOLO)
